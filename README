aodbm - Append Only Database Manager
====================================

An append only database manager in the style of dbm. It has both a C and a 
Python interface and is ACID compliant. Internally it uses a B+ Tree. (Being 
append only doesn't mean that you can't replace records or delete keys).

Getting Started
===============

$ make

This will build a static and shared library.

Python interface
================

# import the module
>>> import aodbm
# create a database object
>>> db = aodbm.AODBM('testdb')
# get the current version of the database
>>> version = db.current_version()
# versions updated either in place or by creating new versions
# in place:
>>> version['hello'] = 'world'
>>> version['hello']
"world"
>>> del version['hello']
# new versions
>>> new_version = version.set_record('hello', 'world')
>>> new_version['hello']
"world"
>>> version['hello']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "aodbm.py", line 56, in __getitem__
    raise KeyError()
KeyError
>>> newest_version = new_version.del_key('hello')
# commiting a new version is simple
>>> db.commit(new_version)
# it returns whether the operation was successful
True
# the operation may fail if you try to commit a version that isn't based on the 
# the current version.

Current Progress
================

It is not yet suitable for production usage. There are a few known bugs in the 
delete function and I'm going to be refactoring much of the code. I'm also 
going to be starting a test suite soon. I consider it to be of (very early) 
beta quality. 

Reporting Bugs
==============

If you find a bug then please write a unit test (in Python if possible) that 
fails and send it to me (Daniel) at Da.Waterworth@gmail.com .

Thanks
